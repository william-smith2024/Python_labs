# Using python as a calculator
#print(2+2)
# when both ** arguments are integers, the result is an integer, too;
# when at least one ** argument is a float, the result is a float, too.
# print(2 ** 2)
# print(2 ** 2.)
# An ** (asterisk) sign is a multiplication operator.

# # # A / (slash) sign is a division operator.
# # # A division sign always lead to a float if needed or not
# print(6 / 3)

# # # # A double // removes float and always rounds
# print(4 / 3)
# print(5 // 3)
# # # # The symobol % is called a  modulo and gives the remainder in divison
# print(14 % 6)
# # # # 5 goes into 14 twice and gives you a remainder of 4 which is why it printed 4 to the line
# print((5 * ((25 % 13) + 100) / (2 * 13)) // 2)
# # # # This equation will complete what is in double parenthsis and then will complete left to right
